# IMPORTANT NOTE
To compile the project, create a new file called "AppSettings.config" as shown below, place it in the "Vidly2" directory and provide your own FacebookAppId and FacebookAppSecret values. You may get these values at "developers.facebook.com." I have omitted my credentials for security reasons.
